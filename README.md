# SuperJumper
Super Jumper was inspired by the well-known Doodle Jump game created by [Lima Sky](http://www.limasky.com/) and originally developed for iOS but in the meantime also ported to Android.
This is the first version of SuperJumper, which is fully playable. In the future I'll keep refactoring and cleaning up the codebase, perhaps even add new features.

## Credits
=============
This version is based on the [GDX library](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), and I heavily followed the '[Managing Game States in C++](http://gamedevgeek.com/tutorials/managing-game-states-in-c/)' tutorial by [Anthony Lewis](http://anthonylewis.com/), so a big thanks to him for that tutorial.
